('DFS-423-A1', '04-06-2023', 'The next section contains the cost of goods sold. This category includes the costs of raw materials, direct labor used in production of products or services, shipping costs for materials and supplies, and overhead. Overhead expenses include costs related to manufacturing facilities. These are expenses such as supervisory labor costs, water, electricity, and insurance for buildings and equipment.', 15665.489, 'The expenses recorded in cost of goods sold match the sales of product and services reported in revenues. Subtracting the cost of goods sold from total revenues produces the gross profit margin.', '', 'Subtracting overhead expenses from the gross profit leaves the earnings before deductions for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, also known as EBITDA. A profit and loss statement is presented in this format to highlight the profitability of a company''s operations before deductions for the financial costs and tax consequences.'),
('DFS-423-B1', '06-04-2023', 'A balance sheet is a list of a company''s assets and liabilities on a specific date. Unlike the P&L, which is a summary of expenses over a period of time, the balance sheet is a picture of the company''s condition at a specific point in time.', 15665.489, 'Assets and liabilities are separated on the balance into short- and long-term accounts. Short-term assets include cash on hand, accounts receivable and inventory. Goods in inventory may be further separated into the amount of raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods ready for sale and shipping. Long-term assets are real estate, buildings, equipment and investments. Total assets must always equal total liabilities. Short-term liabilities are bank loans, accounts payable, accrued expenses, sales tax payable and payroll taxes payable. Long-term liabilities are debts payable in more than one year. These included long-term bonds and leases. The equity portion of the balance sheet has all the company''s investor contributions and the accumulated retained earnings. Stockholder investments include common and preferred stock.', 'A cash flow statement summarizes the cash and cash equivalents that come into and go out of a company''s business operations. While profits are important, a company needs cash to pay its bills. The cash flow statement gives investors a view of how financially solid a company is, and it shows creditors how much cash the business has available to pay its debts and fund its operations.', 'The cash flow statement is different from the income statement and balance sheet because it only records cash activities from operations. It considers movements of cash such as payments of interest, taxes, wages, rents and suppliers. Cash inflows are the receipts from sales of goods and services. This statement does not include sales made on credit or the future collection of accounts receivable.'),
('DFS-422-C1', '10-24-2022', 'Investing activities are any uses of cash for changes in the company''s investments. These include the purchase and sale of assets such as equipment and buildings or long-term securities. Changes in short-term assets, like marketable securities, are recorded on the cash flow statement. Cash flow from financing activities includes payments on outstanding loan balances or receipts from new loans or bonds. Payments of dividends to shareholders and stock repurchases are recorded as cash outflows.', 27274.245, 'The construction of a cash flow statement starts with the company''s profits and then makes adjustments for changes in current assets, investing activities and financing. Note that depreciation is a non-cash item and is added back to net earnings in the cash flow statement.', 'Financial statements prepared by accountants are classified as either audited or unaudited. An audited financial statement signifies that the accountant has verified virtually every transaction and account on the company''s books. Cash balances are checked by obtaining statements from the bank. Accounts receivable are confirmed by asking customers to verify the balances owed. For inventory, the accountants check purchase orders and receipts, and physically count the raw materials and stock on the premises. Government regulations require all publicly traded companies to prepare audited financial statements. The statements must comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and be certified by independent accountants.', 'Unaudited statements, on the other hand, use the financial information presented by the company. The accountants gather the information and prepare the financial statements, but they do not verify or confirm any of the figures. These are known as compilations and are examples of financial reports prepared on an interim basis. Accountants do not express an opinion on unaudited statements. These types of statements are used for the timely release of information, because certified statements take much longer to prepare. Although accountants do not express an opinion on the accuracy of the data in unaudited statements, they are required to notify management if they find misleading or erroneous information.'),
('DFS-423-C3', '01-20-2023', 'Financial statements follow standard presentation formats and apply GAAP to assure consistency. This makes it easier for creditors, investors and management to analyze the statements and make comparisons over time to other companies.', 2752.2425, 'While all financial statements prepared by accountants are connected in some way to profits, the income – or profitability – statement is the one that provides the most details of revenues and expenses and shows profits or losses. While all the financial statements of a business are important and have a distinct purpose, it is the profit and loss statement that gets the most attention. However, a profitability statement can take several forms, and it is essential to understand how they are prepared to make accurate analyses and interpretations.', 'Gross profit is the income derived from manufacturing and selling a product or providing a service. It is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from sales before making deductions for general and administrative expenses. Gross profit margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by sales. It is normally presented as a percentage.', 'The gross profit margin is a measure of how well a company purchases raw materials and uses its labor force to produce and sell a product. Analysts compare each company''s gross profit margin to other firms in the same industry to determine its competitiveness. Management monitors changes in the gross profit percentage for trends that indicate improving or declining performance.'),
('DFS-433-DE', '07-01-2022', 'For example, suppose a company normally reports a gross profit margin of 40 percent, but it increases to 42 percent. What happened? It could be because the company was able to raise selling prices, purchase raw materials at lower prices or use its labor force more productively. All of these occurrences are good. On the other hand, a decline in the gross profit percentage would be cause for alarm, and require management to find the reason for the decline and take corrective actions.', 2951.6512, 'Every company has a certain amount of fixed general and administrative costs that are deducted from gross profits to arrive at operating profits. Fixed overhead costs are those expenses that must be paid regardless of the level of sales. They include such fixed expenses as rent for office space, insurance premiums, salaries for administrative staff, and fees for licenses and permits.', 'Operating profits are another checkpoint to gauge how productively a company is using its assets and controlling its administrative and fixed overhead expenses. Operating profits are calculated before deductions for interest, depreciation, amortization and taxes – frequently referred by the acronym EBITDA.', 'The primary focus of operating profits is to gauge the performance of a business without regard to its financial structure or tax strategies. For example, a business might have a high gross profit margin and good operating profits, but wind up with a low net profit because the firm borrowed a lot of money and had to pay high interest costs. In this case, the company could be doing a good job of using its assets and controlling costs, but have too much debt to show a good profit.'),
('DFS-501-A4', '08-05-2021', 'A balance sheet shows the assets and liabilities of a company at a point in time.', 15961.1561, 'Net income is the bottom line; it is the profit or losses of a business after deductions for all of the company''s expenses, including costs of goods sold and overhead expenses. Net profit reflects the interest costs from the company''s financing structure and the taxes it incurs from tax planning strategies.', 'The bottom line profit is the figure that most analysts and stockholders focus on when evaluating the performance of a company. The percentage of net profit is compared to other companies in the same industry to determine its competitive position.', 'Profitability ratios are valuable metrics used to assess the performance and viability of a business. Ratios produce a more detailed analysis of the quality of profits by expressing specific expenses as percentages of cost of goods sold or sales. Analysts use ratio analysis to look for trends and as a basis of comparison with other companies in the same industry.'),
('DFS-422-A2', '02-06-2023', 'Accountants prepare several types of income statements, depending on the purpose and the intended audience.', 5615.4852, 'After the accountant tallies up the company''s revenues and expenses, the profit or loss is recorded in the retained earnings section of the balance sheet. Any distributions or dividends from this account are detailed on the Statement of Shareholders'' Equity.', 'A profit or loss affects the Statement of Cash Flows a little differently. Income statements are usually prepared on the accrual basis of accounting. This means revenues and expenses are recorded as they are incurred, not when cash actually changes hands. Because an income statement contains certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, the reported profit or loss must be adjusted when preparing a Statement of Cash Flow.', 'The income statement is the most important report for many analysts. It shows the company''s operating results for an entire year. But, more important, it serves as a guide to anticipate how the company might do in the future. Companies must continuously make a profit over the long term to remain competitive and survive. Profits are essential to finance growth and provide a reasonable return to the shareholders.')
